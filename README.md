# Final-Year-Project

  Sign language has proven to be the most natural and oldest form of communication.  Sign language is communicated using a person’s hands or face gestures to express their thoughts and ideas to others. Irish Sign Language is the sign language of Ireland, primarily used in the Republic of Ireland. Irish Sign Language is also used in Northern Ireland, alongside British Sign Language. There are around five thousand deaf people in Ireland that use ISL as their primary or preferred language. An additional forty thousand people can also communicate through ISL
  
  Sign-App, an app that aims to enable people an easy and free way to learn sign language. The app will provide resources such as  basic sign language phrases, a user’s own pictionary that they can expand themselves, and the ability to download other people’s pictionary and image recognition tool to compliment the quiz functionality. The main goal of the project is to enable users to learn sign language in their own time. With the app being a teaching tool, it needs to motivate users and interest the audience enough to come back. The app has potential and room to grow with more functionalities down the line of the software development life cycle. In the end, the user should expect the application to hold a database with their own signs, quizzes to test their knowledge, and a free flowing app that is easy to use.
  
  All the code used can be run by downloading it and running it on Android Studio.
